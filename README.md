So you want to run this project? 


Go to your IDE's terminal and run "git clone https://github.com/encore488/irrigation_ml.git"


Now the project is on your machine! But you still need to install dependencies before you can run it.

So run this command next inside your IDE terminal: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
